# Stock Market Analysis & Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach

## Project Overview

This project showcases a machine learning pipeline designed to analyze historical stock market data, predict closing prices, and classify trading volumes. It leverages fundamental machine learning models—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression—complemented by insightful data visualizations to provide a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics.

### Key Objectives:

  * **Stock Price Prediction:** Utilize regression models (KNN, Linear Regression) to forecast the "Close" price of various stock indices.
  * **Trading Volume Classification:** Employ a classification model (Logistic Regression) to categorize daily trading volumes as "High" or "Low."
  * **Performance Visualization:** Provide clear and comprehensive visualizations to illustrate model performance and underlying data patterns.

## Dataset

The analysis is built upon a dataset comprising historical stock index data. Each entry includes critical market information:

  * **Index:** The name of the stock market index.
  * **Date:** The specific trading date.
  * **Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close:** Standard stock price metrics for the trading day.
  * **Volume:** The total trading volume for the day.

### Preprocessing Steps:

To ensure robust model performance, the dataset underwent the following preprocessing:

  * **Missing Value Imputation:** Handled any missing data points to maintain data integrity.
  * **Categorical Encoding:** The 'Index' column, being categorical, was transformed into numerical format using Label Encoding.
  * **Feature Scaling:** All numerical features were scaled using `StandardScaler` to normalize their ranges, which is crucial for many machine learning algorithms.

## Features Utilized

The following processed features were used as inputs for the machine learning models:

  * `Index` (Encoded numerical value)
  * `Open`
  * `High`
  * `Low`
  * `Adj Close`
  * `Volume`

## Machine Learning Models Implemented

This project employs a selection of widely used machine learning algorithms tailored to the prediction and classification tasks:

### 1\. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for Price Prediction

  * **Application:** Used to predict the continuous "Close" prices.
  * **Optimization:** `n_neighbors`, the key hyperparameter, was tuned using `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal number of neighbors for prediction accuracy.

### 2\. Linear Regression for Price Prediction

  * **Application:** Employed for straightforward prediction of "Close" prices.
  * **Note:** As a linear model, it typically does not require extensive hyperparameter tuning beyond model selection.

### 3\. Logistic Regression for Volume Classification

  * **Application:** Utilized to classify trading volumes into discrete "High" or "Low" categories.
  * **Optimization:** Hyperparameter tuning was performed on `regularization strength C` and `penalty type` using `GridSearchCV` to enhance classification performance.

  * **Data Distribution Plots:** Histograms or box plots of key features.
  * **Time Series Plots:** Trends of stock prices and volume over time.
